1. Safety Requirement I
assert( !( DoorState = Closed and PeopleState = Entering ) )
assert( TrackState != Stopped and DoorState = Closed ) 

2. Liveness Requirement I
if ( TrackState = Stopping and DoorState = Closed and TrainDirection = Coming )
	assert( now - StopTime <= 2 seconds )
	
3. Safety Requirement II
if ( TrackState = Empty )
	assert( now - CloseTime >= 2 seconds )


There are couple unsafety cases I can think we should testï¼Œ I categorize them so it is easy to check:
1. Unsafety Cases
a. TrackStatue & DoorSoorState
( TrackState != Stopped and DoorState = Opened )

b.TrackStatue & PeopleState 
( TrackState != Stopped and PeopleState = Entering )

c. DoorSoorState & PeopleState 
( DoorState = Closed and PeopleState = Entering )
